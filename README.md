# ⚡CUDACyclone: GPU Satoshi Puzzle Solver

Cyclone CUDA is the GPU-powered version of the **Cyclone** project, designed to achieve extreme performance in solving Satoshi puzzles on modern NVIDIA GPUs.  
Leveraging **CUDA**, **warp-level parallelism**, and **batch EC operations**, Cyclone CUDA pushes the limits of cryptographic key search.

Secp256k1 math is based on the excellent work from [JeanLucPons/VanitySearch](https://github.com/JeanLucPons/VanitySearch), and [FixedPaul/VanitySearch-Bitcrack](https://github.com/FixedPaul) with major CUDA-specific modifications.  
Special thanks to Jean-Luc Pons for his foundational contributions to the cryptographic community.

Cyclone CUDA also is the **simplest CUDA-based project** for solving Satoshi puzzles on GPU.  
It was designed with clarity and minimalism in mind — making it easy to **compile, understand, and run**, even for those new to CUDA programming.  

Despite its simplicity, Cyclone CUDA leverages **massive GPU parallelism** to achieve extreme performance in elliptic curve computations and Hash160 pipelines. 

⚠️ **Achieved 6Gkeys/s on RTX4090.**

## 🚀 Key Features

- **GPU Acceleration**: Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs with full CUDA support.
- **Massive Parallelism**: Tens of thousands of threads computing elliptic curve points and **hash160** simultaneously.
- **Batch EC Operations**: Efficient group addition and modular inversion with warp-level optimizations.
- **Grid/Batch Control**: Fully configurable GPU execution with `--grid` parameter (threads per batch × points per batch).
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux and Windows (via WSL2 or MinGW cross-compilation).
- **Cross Architecture**: Automatic compilation for different architectures (75 86 89).
- **Extremely low VRAM usage**: Key feature! For low price rented GPU.
---

## 🚀 Options
- **--range**: range of search. Must be a power of two!
- **--address**: P2PKH address.
- **--target-hash160**: the same as address but hash160.
- **--grid**: very usefull parameter. Example --grid 512,512 - first 512 - number of points each thread will process in one batch (Points batch size)., second 512 - number of threads in one group (Threads per batch).
